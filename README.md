# ðŸš€ FILE SHARE BACKEND
I Developed a **FILE SHARE** Application using **Node Js, Express Js, Mongo DB Backend And Frontend I use HTML, CSS, Vanilla JavaScript**. I also use  **SMTP SERVER**. in this Application. In this application, we transfer any type of File (**JPEG or JPG, PNG, SVG, DOCX, PDF, XLS** etc) Via **Email or Link Sharing**.it with a link so that other people can download it. I will also use nodemailer to send emails using free **SMTP** from our **Node Server**. I will deploy it on the **Heroku Server**. I will also schedule a script on the server so we could delete **24 hours** old files from the storage. In this application, we send  Max **2.5GB** of file.


### How did it work?
**FILE SHARE Application has a full Stack Project. backend portion works main In this project, I will build APIs for a File-sharing app using Node Js, Express Js and Mongo DB. I will upload a file in Node Js. For that, I will use a package called Multer. I will also use nodemailer to send emails using free SMTP from our node server. Finally, we will deploy this project on the live server. I will deploy it on the Heroku server. I will also schedule a script on the server so we could delete 24 hours old files from the storage.**
